					<h1>Personal Background</h1>
					<p><span id="special_text">Hello, my name is Olivia! I am a high school student who created this website for an assignment in one of my courses. Here you will get to learn a little bit about me! As I already mentioned, I am a high school student who is interested in the field of coding and business. I think they go hand in hand and very interesting topic to learn about. I am very interested in the coding aspect and started coding just basic HTML in middle school. I am still learning but I think it is pretty cool. I have worked with HTML, CSS, PHP, Java, JavaScript, Python and Turing.</span></p>
