					<h1>Relationships</h1>
					<p><span id="special_text">We have a really good relationship and we tend to spend a lot of time together. During the holidays we all hang out and we especially enjoy playing board games. I personally think the most fun board game we play is monopoly. We play every year on New Years Eve just to pass time. We also spend a lot of time watching our favourite shows together. We have watched all of the Star Trek series and we just recently watched the movie Person of Interest, which I must say are very enteraining.</span></p>
