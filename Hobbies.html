					<h1>Hobbies</h1>
					<p><span id="special_text">I have a lot of hobbies. In my spare time, I enjoy singing, dancing and listening to music. I listen to a variety of music in different languages and am always looking for more amazing songs to listen to. I don't sing or dance professionally, but I enjoy singing and dancing from time to time just in the comfort of my home. I also really enjoy cooking and baking. I am working to improve my decorating skills especially with cakes and cupcakes and cookies. I take a lot of inspiration from Preppy Kitchen.</span></p>

				<h2>Interests</h2>
				<p id="special_text" style="color: #040b06;"> I've already spoken a lot of my interests in coding, so how about I explain another interest of mine. I love listening to music, singing and dancing, but I did not mention that I played the Cello for a couple of years. I started in elementary and quit part way through high school. It's not that I didn't enjoy playing, I just ran out of time as courses became much busier especially with a job. I played the Cello for 5 years. I found that for the longest time it helped me to perform better in my classes since I taught me more about time management and it has been proven in studies that music helps the brain.</p>

					<h1>Activities</h1>
					<p><span id="special_text">Outside of school and work, I enjoy hanging out with my friends and trying new cafes in the area or just going for a walk and hanging out at eachother's houses. Whenever I am not working or at school or hanging out with friends, I am generally trying to learn a new skills whether it is baking related or coding related. I find it helps keep me productive and actually getting stuff done, while still learning a new skill that can be helpful in the future.</span></p>
