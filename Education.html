					<h1>Education</h1>
					<p><span id="special_text">As I mentioned previously, I am a high school student. I am currently taking a couple of business related classes to expand my knowledge, but I am mainly focusing on my Computer Science classes since that is directly what I want to do after high school. Not only do I take business and computer science, I also take a second language course. I am learning French. I started learning French back in kindergarten. I have always loved learning different languages that I started learning a little bit of Spanish, Tagalog and Korean. I am by no means fluent in Korean, Tagalog and Spanish since I stopped learning after a little while, but I can still pick up some words here and there.</span></p>
